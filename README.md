This project predicts the weight of fish based on measurements such as length, height, and width using random forest regression model.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Fish Market Dataset and downloaded from Kaggle.

## Model

A regression model was built using the mean square error to predict the weight of the fish.

## Files

- `model.pkl`: The saved regression model.
- `app.py`: Flask API to serve the model.
- `index.html`: Frontend for input and predictions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Flask app: `python app.py`.
4. Open `index.html` in your browser and input fish measurements to get a weight prediction.

## Deployment

The model is deployed on render (https://fish-weight-prediction2002-1.onrender.com/).

## GitHub Repository
